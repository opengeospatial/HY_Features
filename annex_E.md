## ANNEX E - Code lists for the HY_Features model
### E.1 Terms identifying a fixed landmark determined as reference point

| Codelist | **Reference Point Typ** |
| --- | --- |
| barrage | barrier across a stream provided with a series of gates or other control mechanisms to control the water-surface level upstream, to regulate the flow or to divert water supplies into a canal. |
| bifurcation | division of a stream into two branches.
| confluence | joining, or the place of junction, of two or more streams. |
| dam | barrier constructed across a valley for impounding water or creating a reservoir. |
| diversion of water | transfer of water from one watercourse to another, such watercourses being either natural or man-made.|
| fork | (1) place where two or more streams flow together to form a larger stream. (2) place where a stream divides into two or more streams.|
| hydrometric station | station at which data on water in rivers, lakes or reservoirs are obtained on one or more of the following elements: stage, streamflow, sediment transport and deposition, water temperature and other physical properties of water, characteristics of ice cover and chemical properties of water. |
| inlet | structure admitting water supplies from the source or through an intake structure built upstream. |
| intake| structure or site, the purpose of which is to control, regulate, divert, and admit water directly from the source, through an inlet built upstream. |
| outlet| opening through which water flows out or is extracted from a reservoir or stream. |
| ponor | hole or opening in the bottom or side of a depression where a surface stream or lake flows either partially or completely underground into a karst groundwater system |
| rapids | reach of a stream where the flow is very swift and shooting, and where the surface is usually broken by obstructions, but has no actual waterfall or cascade. |
| reference climatological station | climatological station the data of which are intended for the purpose of determining climatic trends. This requires long periods (not less than thirty years) of homogeneous records, where man-made environmental changes have been and/or are expected to remain at a minimum. Ideally the records should be of sufficient length to enable the identification of secular changes of climate. |
| river mouth | place of discharge of a river into a sea or a lake.  |
| sinkhole | place where water disappears underground in a limestone region. It generally implies water loss in a closed depression or blind valley. |
| source | origin of river. |
| spring | place where water flows naturally from a rock or soil onto land or into a body of surface water. |
| waterfall | vertical fall or the very steep descent of a stream of water.  |
| weir | overflow structure which may be used for controlling upstream water level or for measuring discharge or for both. |

### E.2 Terms commonly used in hydrology to describe a spatial relation between two points

| Codelist | **Relative position Type** |
| --- | --- |
| at | located at the (reference) point |
| between | located between two (reference) points |
| downstream | located downstream of the (reference) point, e.g. in the direction of the current in a river or stream.|
| left | located left-hand of the (reference) point when facing downstream. | 
| nearby | located in a short distance to the (reference) point. |
| right | located right-hand of the (reference) point when facing downstream. |
| upstream | located upstream of the (reference) point, e.g. in the direction towards the source of a stream. |

### E.3 Terms commonly used in hydrology to describe a drainage pattern 

| Codelist | **Drainage pattern** |
| --- | --- |
| annular | main rivers have circular pattern with subsidiary channels at right angels. |
| centripetal | streams flow inward to center. |
| dendritic | spreading treelike arrangement; no evident orientation of channels (random orientation). |
| distributary | one main channel divides into many channel-ways ending with many outlets. | 
| parallel | main channels regularly spaced and parallel or sub-parallel to each  other; tributaries join at very acute angels. |
| pinnate | featherlike, closely grouped , short tributaries (fine texture). |
| radial | streams flow outward from center. |
| rectangular | drainage forms a perpendicular net with the two directions equally developed. |
| trellis | a dominant drainage direction with a secondary direction perpendicular to this; primary tributaries join main stream at right angles, secondary tributaries parallel main stem. |

### E.4 ISO standards relevant to the romanisation, transcription or transliteration of characters of another alphabet into Latin characters

### E.5 Terms commonly used to indicate the type of name usage.

| Codelist | **Usage Type** |
| --- | --- |
| conventional | accepted, used, or practiced by most people ('agreed by convention') |
| historical | restricted to or based on fact in history |
| official | ordered or allowed by those in authority |
| vernacular | used in or suitable for speech, usually not used in formal writing |
