                                     skos:definition """The HydroFeature module (Figure 21) provides the core concepts of a named hydrologic feature in the Named Feature, of a hydrologic complex in which the union of catchment and its common outlet is realized in several ways by a collection of hydrologic features, and of a river referencing system which allows placement of an arbitrary feature ‘along a river’ using linear referencing along a one-dimensional topological, flowpath realization.

The HY_HydroFeature feature type is defined as hydrology-specific instance of the General Feature metaclass (as defined in the OGC General Feature Model, GFM), whose identity needs to be maintained and tracked through a processing chain from measurement to distribution of hydrologic information.
As an instance of the General Feature metaclass a feature type is identified by a unique identifier and typical properties. Typically, a hydrologic feature is additionally identified through names in common usage and through hydrologically significant characteristics.

The HY_HydroFeature feature type is specialized into more specific feature types (Figure 23), which specify additional properties and represent particular hydrologic phenomena.Providing a standard terminology for the typical relationships between hydrologic features allows the hydrosphere to be expressed in a consistent way across multiple data products, regardless of various spatial or temporal representations.

The definitions of HydroFeature feature types are rooted in the definitions documented in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology. They are applied regardless of their application context in respect to the Earth's surface. For the purpose of testing the applicability of the HY_Features conceptual model in the context of surface water hydrology, the definitions in this standard refer to surface water hydrology. A conceptual model capturing the specifics of features associated with the groundwater domain is developed with reference to the OGC WaterML 2: Part 4 – GroundwaterML2 standard."""@en ,

The Hydrometric Network model specifies the concepts defined in the Hydro Feature core model.. The general concept is that of a network of logically connected hydrometric stations realizing as a whole the catchment. This enables contextually related information models to relate monitoring stations and observing posts to hydrologic features, as is often required for environmental reporting or when interpreting, analyzing and processing observation results."""@en ,

This will enable contextually linked information models to build relationships between multiple realizations of the same catchments. Typical realizations of the catchment concept and hydro nexuses can be described in a consistent way using standard terminology for the relationships between surface water features defined in this application schema.

The Surface Hydro Feature model (Figure 37) conceptualizes the accumulation of water on the land surface in waterbodies, each made unique by its origin, size, or movement. With respect to the management and storage of water resources, a concept of water storage is provided and allows any waterbody type to be considered a managed reservoir.

Relying on a conceptual separation of waterbody and container, the Surface Hydro Feature schema defines a network of potentially connected depressions and channels on the land surface which periodically or continuously contain water. Separate from the hydrographic network of permanent or temporary waterbodies, the channel network can be used as the connecting system.

The definitions in this schema are rooted in the definitions given in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology which defines a network of watercourse regardless of the location in respect to the Earth's surface. The conceptual model defined here has been vetted in the context of surface water hydrology. In other words, in this standard, 'channel network' and 'hydrographic network' refer to surface channels or other containers for surface-waterbodies.

The Surface Hydro Feature application schema contains the leaf packages: Channel Network, Hydrographic Network, Water Body Types and Storage."""@en .
