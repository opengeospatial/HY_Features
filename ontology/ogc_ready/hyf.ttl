The indirect position is then expressed as the distance from the upstream and/or downstream end of the flowpath, or from a referent that is already located on that flowpath.  The (indirect) position of an outflow node referenced along an upstream oriented flowpath can be expressed as the distance from an upstream inflow node located on that flowpath, while the (indirect) position of an inflow node referenced along a downstream oriented flowpath can be expressed as distance from a downstream outflow node located on the flowpath. An ‘intermediate’ position referencing known inflow and outflow nodes bounding a flowpath at both ends can be expressed as part of the distance along the entire flowpath, measured from the upstream end of an upstream flowpath, and/or from the downstream end of a downstream flowpath. A position referencing an already referenced location on the flowpath can be expressed as part of the distance along the entire flowpath, measured from the ‘located referent’.   HY_IndirectPosition carries the distanceExpression, and distanceDescription attributes, and has linearElement, locatedReferent and a referenceLocation associations.

The hydro nexus concept is used to define the hydrologic determination of a catchment but, like the catchment concept, does not have inherent realization(s). Any hydrologically significant feature that can be identified as (said to be) the outlet of a catchment may realize the hydro nexus. Typically, this will be a permanent, stable location that is fixed and/or referenced by coordinates.  Landmarks such as confluences, points corresponding to vertical sections, or the position of a monitoring station on a river are typical realizations of the hydro nexus. Other kinds of hydro nexus realizations that don't carry normal surface water characteristics as defined in this standard, e.g. a spring where groundwater enters the surface, an arbitrary point projected onto the surface, or a nexus that collects many disjoint locations may use or specialize the general HY_HydroLocation type.  Topologically, the HY_HydroLocation should be understood to be the boundary of the corresponding catchment, and always of lower topological dimension than the catchment. Even though the topological realization of a hydro nexus is typically as a node between catchment edges, a nexus realization may also have any geometric representation, including a single point. In many cases, HY_HydroLocations are known but corresponding catchments and hydro nexuses are not defined. For example, stream gages that are part of a catchment dataset whose hydro nexus features are realized by confluences. Both the stream gages and confluences are HY_HydroLocations, but the stream gages’ hydro nexus features are not defined. Using this concept, HY_HydroLocation is expected to be used to link between datasets that have catchments delineated for different HY_HydroLocations. HY_HydroLocation carries two attributes: shape and hydroLocationType. It has referencedPosition and realizedNexus associations implying the hydro-complex feature collection."@en .

The HY_HydroFeature feature type is defined as hydrology-specific instance of the General Feature metaclass (as defined in the OGC General Feature Model, GFM), whose identity needs to be maintained and tracked through a processing chain from measurement to distribution of hydrologic information.\nAs an instance of the General Feature metaclass a feature type is identified by a unique identifier and typical properties. Typically, a hydrologic feature is additionally identified through names in common usage and through hydrologically significant characteristics.  The HY_HydroFeature feature type is specialized into more specific feature types (Figure 23), which specify additional properties and represent particular hydrologic phenomena.Providing a standard terminology for the typical relationships between hydrologic features allows the hydrosphere to be expressed in a consistent way across multiple data products, regardless of various spatial or temporal representations. The definitions of HydroFeature feature types are rooted in the definitions documented in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology. They are applied regardless of their application context in respect to the Earth's surface. For the purpose of testing the applicability of the HY_Features conceptual model in the context of surface water hydrology, the definitions in this standard refer to surface water hydrology. A conceptual model capturing the specifics of features associated with the groundwater domain is developed with reference to the OGC WaterML 2: Part 4 – GroundwaterML2 standard."@en .

A realization of the logical catchment is always of higher topological dimension than the realization of the corresponding hydro nexus topological boundary. For example, a linear flowpath realizing a catchment may be understood as an edge between inflow and outflow nodes; the areal realization of a catchment as a face bounded by linear inflow and outflow. The catchment realization features defined in this standard refer to objects on the land surface for the purpose of surface water hydrology. In other contexts, other types of catchment realization may exist.
