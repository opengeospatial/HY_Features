				1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydrologic Features Standards Working Group
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			Water information is required to be shared across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries, which is facilitated by OGC's interoperability standards. The joint WMO-OGC Hydrology Domain Working Group (DWG) brings together interested parties to develop and promote the technology for improving the way in which water information is organized, managed and shared.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hydrologic features are the unit of water information required to convey identity of real-world water-objects through the data processing chain from observation to water information. The work undertaken in the Hydrology DWG led to a series of water-related specifications to manage at different levels of detail the identification, observation and representation of hydrologic features. Examples are the WaterML2.0 standard, the HY_Features common hydrologic feature model and the GroundWaterML2 ongoing work. Even if concerned with different aspects of hydrology and water information, these standards imply a common understanding of the Hydrology phenomenon, which provides the basis of linking application-specific concepts by referencing common semantics. This allows domain-specific information systems, web services as well as ontologies to be linked using a common reference model.
		</p>
		<div>
			<h1>
				2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of this Standards Working Group
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			The purpose of this Standards Working Group is to progress the HY_Features common hydrologic feature model to the state of an adopted OGC standard for a common and stable identification and referencing of hydrologic features.
		</p>
		<p>
			This goal will be achieved by developing and publishing a draft standard, by processing comments received during a public comment period, and ensuring that the standard is consistent with the OGC Standards Baseline.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Hydrologic Features standard will be split into 3 parts, so that conceptual issues can be addressed separate from the GML schemas and machine-readable OWL versions of the model for practical use.
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 1: HY_Features conceptual model (OGC14-111). The normative model is a machine-readable UML artefact published by OGC.
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 2: GML implementation schema suitable for data transfer of HY_Features object instances, based on ISO 19136 Annex E encoding rules for Application Schema.
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 3: OWL and RDF representation suitable for defining links between features that implement the HY_Features model, based on ISO 19150 encoding rules.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final deliverable of the SWG will be separate versions of each intended part of the Hydrologic Feature candidate standard for consideration by the OGC membership for approval as an OGC standard and include contribution to the OGC Abstract Specification.
		</p>
		<div>
			<h1>
				3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business Value Proposition
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			The HY_Features common hydrologic feature model (OGC 11-039r3) is a formalism of definitions published in the WMO/UNESCO International Glossary of Hydrology (WMO Series no. 385) as a domain model using ISO 19100 series domain modelling standards.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			The HY_Features model describes the most important hydrologic features by defining the fundamental relationships among the major components of the hydrosphere, including the hierarchy of basins and the segmentation of watercourses, to reflect hydrologic significance and topological connectivity of hydrologic features independent from geometric representation and scales.
		</p>
		<p>
			The HY_Features model allows for a common and stable referencing wherever hydrologic features are required to be references,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to assist hydrologic observations to identify the target feature-of-interest,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to assist the aggregation of generated data represented in various data sets in current use into integrated suites of datasets on global, regional, or basin scales,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to enable information systems to link distributed data across application domains,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to enable cross-domain services to communicate by referencing common, shared concepts.
		</p>
		<div>
			<h1>
				4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope of Work
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			This SWG is focused on the development of the Hydrologic Features candidate standard submission, coordinating a public comment period, and processing any comments received during this period. This procedure will apply to all of the three intended parts of the standard.
		</p>
		<p>
			The SWG will assist the development of example use cases to promote the use of the HY_Features conceptual model in order to improve the semantic interoperability of web services related to hydrology. A potential use case for the Hydrologic Features standard may be the discovery, access, and use of relationships between hydrologic features represented in data sets exposed as web services. Such a scenario may include requests for data awaiting response from two or more web services.
		</p>
		<p>
			By defining common feature types, the Hydrologic Features standard will provide a basis for the mapping of the realized common feature concept to the specific concept of a particular feature of interest. Such mappings will add context and concept information to a data request. The SWG will prepare some explanatory material to assist implementers to define and handle the conceptual mapping of application-specific features and hydrology-domain feature types as defined in the HY_Features conceptual model.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statement of relationship of planned work to the current OGC standards baseline
		</h2>
		<p>
			This work is intended to be aligned with the existing OGC standards baseline where appropriate.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is Out of Scope?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Even if the Hydrologic Features candidate standard will provide a reference model enabling information systems to link hydrologic data distributed across application domains and Web services to communicate using technologies of the semantic Web, this standard will not specify a specific communication technology or service interface.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific Contribution of Existing Work as a Starting Point
		</h2>
		<p>
			The starting point for the work will be the Discussion Paper OGC 11-039r3: “HY_Features: a Common Hydrologic Feature Model.” The work undertaken in the OWS 10 Cross Community Interoperability Hydro Model Interoperability effort, as documented in the Engineering Report OGC 14-048, as well as the already existing implementations of HY_Features concepts in the AU Hydrological Geo Fabric (AHGF) at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, in the Spatial Identifier Reference Framework (SIRF) developed at CSIRO, and in the Open Management Platform (OMP) of the European WatERP Project may be considered in terms of OGC’s IEs.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determination of SWG Completion
		</h2>
		<p>
			The work of the SWG will be complete when for each of the three parts of the standard:
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A draft standard has been developed and circulated for comments;
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All comments submitted during the 30-day public comment period have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the SWG;
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SWG approves the candidate standard for submission to the TC for approval as an adopted standard; and
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TC and the PC approve the candidate standard and all comments in the approval processes are addressed.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a persistent SWG?
		</h2>
		<p>
			X Yes&nbsp;
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When can SWG be inactivated or rechartered?
		</h2>
		<p>
			See criteria in section 4.4.
