				1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydrologic Features (HY_Features) - Surface Water Conceptual Model Standards Working Group
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			Water information needs to be shared across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries, which can be facilitated by OGC's interoperability standards. The joint WMO-OGC Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG) brings together interested parties to develop and promote the technology for improving the way in which water information is organized, managed and shared.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hydrologic features are the unit of water information required to convey identity of real-world water-objects through the data processing chain from observation to water information. 
			The work undertaken in the Hydrology DWG led to a series of water-related specifications to manage at different levels of detail the identification, observation and representation of hydrologic features. 
			These standards include WaterML2.0: Part 1 - Time Series and WaterML2.0 Part 2 - Ratings, Gaugings, and Sections; WaterML-WQ an O&amp;M and WaterML 2.0 profile for water quality data (1.0); a proposed conceptual model and encoding for Groundwater Features, and this prospective conceptual model standard for hydrologic features. 
			While these standards addess different aspects of hydrology and water information, they are formed around a common understanding of Hydrology. 
			This common understanding provides conceptual information architecture to be used to link hydo-science application-specific concepts by referencing common semantics alowwing hydrologic and other domain-specific information systems, web services, and ontologies to be linked using a common reference model.
		</p>
		<p>
			This standard provides a reference model defining real-world water-objects and the way they relate to each other according to hydro-science domain defined semantics and network topology. 
			It is defined under the umbrella of the joint WMO-OGC hydrology domain working group and is meant to form the groundwork for future hydrologic feature encoding standards among other applications. 
			The SWG envisions future work to define encoding standards that would extend or add to the technical baseline that is the system of WaterML2.0 encoding standards. 
		</p>
		<div>
			<h1>
				2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of this Standards Working Group
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			The purpose of this Standards Working Group is to progress a common surface water hydrologic feature model to the state of an adopted OGC standard for a common and stable identification and referencing of hydrologic features.
		</p>
		<p>
			This goal will be achieved by developing and publishing a draft standard, by processing comments received during a public comment period, and ensuring that the standard is consistent with the OGC Standards Baseline.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Hydrologic Features standard will be split into 2 parts, so that the conceptual model--for use in later conceptual model and data encoding development--can be addressed separatly from a machine-readable OWL version of the model--for use in feature identification and linking applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 1: Surface Water Features conceptual model (OGC14-111). The normative model is a machine-readable UML artefact published by OGC.
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 2: Surface Water Features OWL and RDF representation suitable for defining links between features that implement the HY_Features model, based on ISO 19150 encoding rules.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final deliverable of the SWG will be separate versions of each intended part of the Hydrologic Feature candidate standard for consideration by the OGC membership for approval as an OGC standard and include contribution to the OGC Abstract Specification.
		</p>
		<div>
			<h1>
				3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business Value Proposition
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			The HY_Features common hydrologic feature model (OGC 11-039r3) is a formalism based on definitions published in the WMO/UNESCO International Glossary of Hydrology (WMO Series no. 385) as a domain model using ISO 19100 series domain modelling standards.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			The HY_Features model describes surface hydrologic features by defining the fundamental relationships among major components of the hydrosphere--such as the hierarchy of drainage basins and segmentation of watercourses--to reflect hydrologic significance and topological network connectivity of hydrologic features. This is accomplished in a way that is independent from geometric representation or scale of the described features.
		</p>
		<p>
			The HY_Features model will allow for common and stable reference definitions wherever hydrologic features and relationships are required,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to assist identification of the target feature-of-interest of hydrologic observations,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to assist the assimilation of data represented in various data sets into integrated datasets or computer software on global, regional, or basin scales,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to enable information systems to link distributed data across application domains,
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to enable cross-domain services to communicate by referencing common, shared concepts.
		</p>
		<div>
			<h1>
				4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope of Work
			</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			This SWG is focused on the development of the HY_Features candidate standard submission, coordinating a public comment period, and processing any comments received during this period. This procedure will apply to both intended parts of the standard.
		</p>
		<p>
			The SWG will assist the development of example use cases to promote the use of the HY_Features conceptual model in order to improve the semantic interoperability of web services related to hydrology. A potential use case for the Hydrologic Features standard may be the discovery, access, and use of relationships between hydrologic features represented in data sets exposed as web services. Such a scenario may include requests for data awaiting response from two or more web services.
		</p>
		<p>
			By defining common feature types, the HY_Features standard will provide a basis for the mapping of the realized common feature concept to the specific concept of a particular feature of interest. Such mappings will add context and concept information to a data request. The SWG will prepare some explanatory material to assist implementers to define and handle the conceptual mapping of application-specific features and hydrology-domain feature types as defined in the HY_Features conceptual model.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statement of relationship of planned work to the current OGC standards baseline
		</h2>
		<p>
			This work is intended to be aligned with the existing OGC standards baseline where appropriate.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is Out of Scope?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The HY_Features candidate standard will provide a reference model enabling information systems to link hydrologic features and related data distributed across application domains and Web services; however, this standard will not specify specific data encodings, communication technologies or service interfaces.
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of the HY_Features candidate standard is to provide the high level conceptual basis for describing how conceptual hydrologic features in particular applications or implementations of hydrologic features relate to common hydrologic science concepts. The standard is not intended to allow direct encoding or transformation of one application or implementation to another. Future work, such as invisioned by RiverML, is expected to take on the task of developing a common information model or encoding for hydrologic feature data.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific Contribution of Existing Work as a Starting Point
		</h2>
		<p>
			The starting point for the work will be the Discussion Paper OGC 11-039r3: “HY_Features: a Common Hydrologic Feature Model.” The work undertaken in the OWS 10 Cross Community Interoperability Hydro Model Interoperability effort, as documented in the Engineering Report OGC 14-048, as well as the already existing implementations of HY_Features concepts in the AU Hydrological Geo Fabric (AHGF) at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, in the Spatial Identifier Reference Framework (SIRF) developed at CSIRO, and in the Open Management Platform (OMP) of the European WatERP Project may be considered in terms of OGC’s IEs.
		</p>
		<h2>
			4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determination of SWG Completion
		</h2>
		<p>
			The work of the SWG will be complete when for each of the three parts of the standard:
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A draft standard has been developed and circulated for comments;
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All comments submitted during the 30-day public comment period have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the SWG;
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SWG approves the candidate standard for submission to the TC for approval as an adopted standard; and
		</p>
		<p>
			·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TC and the PC approve the candidate standard and all comments in the approval processes are addressed.
		</p>
